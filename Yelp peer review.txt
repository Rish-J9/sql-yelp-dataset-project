Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

by Rishabh Janbandhu



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding


1)Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

i.   Attribute table   = 10000
ii.  Business table    = 10000
iii. Category table    = 10000
iv.  Checkin table     = 10000
v.   elite_years table = 10000
vi.  friend table      = 10000
vii. hours table       = 10000
viii.photo table       = 10000
ix.  review table      = 10000
x.   tip table         = 10000
xi.  user table        = 10000

Sample code (includes null values too):

select count(*)     /* counts the total number of records in all columns */
from table_name;    /* substitute any table name ex: attribute*/




2) Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:

i.   Business  = 10,000
ii.  Hours     = 1562
iii. Category  = 2643
iv.  Attribute = 1115
v.   Review    = 10,000
vi.  Checkin   = 493
vii. Photo     = 10,000
viii.Tip       = 537
ix.  User      = 10,000
x.   Friend    = 11
xi.  Elite_years = 2780

Sample code:

select count(distinct name) + count(distinct business_id) + count(distinct value) as total_records
from attribute;                                                                                     /*we have taken from the attribute table. we can use any other table */

total records returned are 1115.  (for attribute table)

Foreign keys: business_id, user_id  (in review table)




3) Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

answer: 'NO' 

Sample code :

select id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos 
from user
where id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny = NULL or cool = NULL or fans= NULL or average_stars= NULL or compliment_hot= NULL or compliment_more= NULL or compliment_profile= NULL or compliment_cute= NULL or compliment_list= NULL 
or compliment_note= NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool= NULL or compliment_funny= NULL or compliment_writer= NULL or compliment_photos= NULL;

 


4)For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

  i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:  1 		max:	5	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:  1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995


Sample Code:
 
  select min(stars), max(stars), avg(stars)
  from review;                     /*we can insert any table name in place of review*/



5) List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

   SQL code used to arrive at the answer:

   select city, sum(review_count) as total_review
   from business
   group by city
   order by total_review desc;


+-----------------+--------------+

	Select name, id, review_count
      from user
      ORDER BY review_count DESC
      LIMIT 3;

| Sara   | -3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg |         1629 |
| Yuri   | -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |         1339 |
+--------+------------------------+--------------+	




8)Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:


Answer: NO. As we can see from table below, Gerald has more review counts but has less fans. Therefore, sorting the users in descending order based on their total number of reviews does not sort the fans in the same order,
         meaning that there is not a correlation between the total number of reviews and number of fans. 



select name, id, review_count, fans
from user
order by review_count desc;

+-----------+------------------------+--------------+------+
| name      | id                     | review_count | fans |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis


1) 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
City: Toronto        Category: Food 
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	          Yes
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
                Yes
	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

From the results , we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. 
Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 


	SQL code used for analysis:

select b.name, b.city, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count, b.postal_code
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto' 
group by b.stars;


+-----------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                  | city    | category              | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
+-----------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+

+-----------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+




2)	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
	
            The business that are still open have higher rating.
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
	
           The business that are still open have more reviews.

	iii.	Difference 3:
            The business that are still open have longer working hours.

	SQL code used for analysis:

	select b.name, b.is_open, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count, b.postal_code
      from business b  
      inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
      inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
      where b.city = 'Mesa' 
      group by b.is_open;



+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+

+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+





3) For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. 
These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
>>>> Determine if there is a correlation between category and star rating within a city
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
>>>> I joined data from the business table with the categories table to see if the a business category has a impact on stars (or viceversa) in the city of Mesa . I also pulled review_count and is_open as this factor may affect the analysis       

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+------+-----------------------------+-------+--------------+---------+
| city | category                    | stars | review_count | is_open |
+------+-----------------------------+-------+--------------+---------+
